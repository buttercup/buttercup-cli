⚠️ **Project Closure** ⚠️

The Buttercup project has come to an end, and these repositories are in transition to becoming public archives. No public-facing resources will be removed, wherever possible. Please do not create issues or PRs - they will unfortunately be ignored. Discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/discussions/1395), and explanation [here](https://gist.github.com/perry-mitchell/43ebfcec4d874b77a704be1d4f2262e6).

## WIP
This is a work in progress and may not be fully functional yet. Please use with caution and do not use in a production environment.

## Installation
Install Buttercup CLI globally using `sudo npm install -g buttercup-cli`, and use the `bcup` command in your terminal to run the program.

## Usage
`bcup [filename]`

Buttercup CLI will provide a main menu, which can be optionally skipped by providing the path to a Buttercup archive file.
