# Buttercup CLI
Buttercup password manager for the command line

## WIP
This is a work in progress and may not be fully functional yet. Please use with caution and do not use in a production environment.

## Installation
Install Buttercup CLI globally using `sudo npm install -g buttercup-cli`, and use the `bcup` command in your terminal to run the program.

## Usage
`bcup [filename]`

Buttercup CLI will provide a main menu, which can be optionally skipped by providing the path to a Buttercup archive file.
